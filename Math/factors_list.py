# Example for Better Understanding:
# Let's say n = 6.

# We initialize: factor_count = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

# Now we go through:

# i = 1: increments factor_count[1 to 6] by 1 â†’ all numbers are divisible by 1
# â†’ [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

# i = 2: increments 2, 4, 6
# â†’ [0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]

# i = 3: increments 3, 6
# â†’ [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]

# i = 4: increments 4
# â†’ [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3]

# i = 5: increments 5
# â†’ [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3]

# i = 6: increments 6
# â†’ [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4]

# So:

# 1 has 1 factor

# 2 has 2 factors â†’ (1, 2)

# 3 has 2 factors â†’ (1, 3)

# 4 has 3 factors â†’ (1, 2, 4)

# 5 has 2 factors â†’ (1, 5)

# 6 has 4 factors â†’ (1, 2, 3, 6)

# ðŸ’¡ Why is it Efficient?
# Instead of checking each number individually (which takes O(âˆšn) time per number), we flip the process:

# Each number i marks itself as a factor for all its multiples.

# The outer loop runs n times.

# The inner loop runs n/i times for each i, so total work is approximately:

# n/1 + n/2 + n/3 + ... + n/n = O(n log n)

# Much better than O(nâˆšn) if you're checking each number with the optimal approach one by one.
